# Dependencies to AL-Go projects in other repositories
Many partners have a set of common helper functions, tables and other things, which they reuse in other apps.

With AL-Go for GitHub, the recommendation is to create a Common repository, which has one or more projects, which can be used in several of your other apps.

### Create repository freddydkorg/common

### Add common app

### Add licensing app

### Add dependency to common app from licensing

### Add dependency from mysolution.w1 to licensing

### cannot build

### Add appDependencyProbingPaths to AlGoOrgSettings


### add GitHubPackagesContext to secrets

### run CI/CD in common

### run CI/CD in mysolution - magic
