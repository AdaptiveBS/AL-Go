# #13 Setup your own GitHub runner to increase workflow performance
*Prerequisites: An AL-Go repository setup using one of the scenarios*

When running the CI/CD workflow, the build job is by far the most time consuming job. By adding your own GitHub Runner, which can cache the generic image, the build image and also the artifacts, the time for running the build job can become much faster.

GitHub runners can be registered for an organization (accessible for all repositories in the organization) or for a single repository.

1. Navigate to https://github.com/organizations/{organization}/settings/actions/runners/new to create a self-hosted runner for your organization. Use https://github.com/{organization}/{repository}/settings/actions/runners to create a self-hosted runner for a single repository.

1. To create a self-hosted runner manually, choose Windows under Runner Image and x64 in architecture and follow the description on how to create a self-hosted runner manually.
1. To create an Azure VM hosting x self-hosted runners, open a new tab and navigate to https://aka.ms/getbuildagent.
1. Enter the **Resource Group name**, **Region**, **VM Name**, **Admin Password** of your choise.
1. Enter the **number of agents** you want to create on the VM.
1. Grab the **token**, the **organization Url** and the **Agent Url** from the Create Self-Hosted runner page, and specify **self-hosted** in labels.

1. Select **Review and Create** and then review the deployment and click **Create**.
1. Wait for the Azure VM creation to finalize, navigate back to see that the Runners have been registered and are ready to use.

1. Click the runner group **Default** and allow public repositories if your repository is public

1. Now navigate to your project settings file (.AL-Go/settings.json) and set **gitHubRunner** to **self-hosted**.
1. Save and inspect your workflows performance increase on the second run.
1. Inspect that one of the runners pick up the workflow
